# UFOs

## Purpose
    Create a web page that allows us to view the information we have collected
    and that also has filters that facilitate the search.

## Results
    - At the beginning we will find all the information available in the table, without filters. (image A-1)

![]()

    - To the left of the table we can see that there is a title that says "Filter Search" below are
    all filters available (image B-1).

![]()

    - In "Enter date" we can enter the date we want to search for specifically and it will return us
    the corresponding information (image C-1).

    - We can search by city, state, country and shape at the same time (image D-1).

## Summary

#### cons
    - By not having a search button, the search is done automatically, which is interesting because you see it
    interactive but if you place a single letter and change the field it will delete everything since none of them does
    match with a single letter.

#### recommendations
    - Only valid values should be allowed in each field, in the present design letters can be placed
    in the date field for example.
    - A pagination could be added when the table exceeds a certain size.
    - Value selection could also be added without the need to write it.
